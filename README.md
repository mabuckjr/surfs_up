# Surf's Up!
Resources: Python, Pandas, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and Numpy
## Overview
In this challenge, we accessed a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy to look at weather data in Oahu. We were getting this data to see if it would be a good idea to open a surfing and ice cream shop there. W. Avy, our boss/investor, liked our initial analysis through the activities, but wanted to make sure that the location would be good for year-round business. He decided that the best way to see if it would work would be to analyze the weather in June and December to see how much it differed from each other. We used SQLAlchemy to pull the data from the database and analyze it using Pandas and Numpy.

#### Below are 3 main takeaways from the analysis:
- The average temperature in December (~71 degrees) was only ~4 degrees cooler than the temperature in June (~75 degrees)
- The minimum temperature can be as much as ~8 degrees cooler (~56 degrees) in December than it is in June (~64 degrees)
- The maximum temperature difference between June (85 degrees) and December (83 degrees) was only 2 degrees
